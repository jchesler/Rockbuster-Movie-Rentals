Find the average amount paid by the top 5 customers:

WITH total_amount_paid_top_5_customers
(customer_id,amount,first_name,last_name,city,country) AS
(SELECT A.customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total_paid,B.first_name,
B.last_name,D.city,E.country
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.City_id
INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
WHERE city IN ('Aurora','Atlixco','Xintai','Adoni',
              'Dhule(Dhulia)','Kurashiki','Pingxiang',
              'Sivas','Celaya','So Leopoldo')
GROUP BY A.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name,D.city,E.country
ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC
LIMIT 5)
SELECT AVG(amount)
FROM total_amount_paid_top_5_customers

How many of the top 5 customers are based within each country:

WITH top_5_customers (customer_id,first_name, last_name,city,country,
amount) AS
(SELECT A.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, D.city, E.country, SUM
(amount) AS total_amount_paid
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = d.city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
WHERE city IN ('Aurora','Atlixco','Xintai','Adoni',
'Dhule(Dhulia)','Kurashiki','Pingxiang',
'Sivas','Celaya','So Leopoldo')
GROUP BY A.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, D.city, E.country
ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC
LIMIT 5)
SELECT D.country, COUNT(A.customer_id) AS all_customer_count, COUNT
(top_5_customers.customer_id) AS top_customer_count
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
LEFT JOIN top_5_customers ON A.customer_id = top_5_customers.customer_id
